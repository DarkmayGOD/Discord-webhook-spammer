You need to have installed python3 for this!!!


Installation:

1) Move the file to your desktop.
2) Open run.cmd (It will run the python file.)


Manual installation:

1) Open CMD
2) Type in the cmd "cd (location where is your file, I recommend to give it to the desktop.) desktop"
3) py wbookspammer.py
4) Done!

If "py" does not working, try to use "python"

If you are scared of the file, or you do not wanna install Python on your computer, you can use replit.com
